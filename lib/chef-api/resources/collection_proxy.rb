    #
    # Create a new collection proxy from the given parent class and collection
    # information. The collection proxy aims to make working with nested
    # resource collections a bit easier. The proxy waits until non-existing
    # data is requested before making another HTTP request. In this way, it
    # helps reduce bandwidth and API requets.
    #
    # Additionally, the collection proxy caches the results of an object request
    # in memory by +id+, so additional requests for the same object will hit the
    # cache, again reducing HTTP requests.

    # @param [Class] klass

    # Fetch the object collection from the Chef Server. Since the Chef Server's
    # API is completely insane and all over the place, it might return a Hash
    # where the key is the id of the resource and the value is the url for that
    # item on the Chef Server:
    #
    #     { "key" => "url" }
    #
    # Or if the Chef Server's fancy is tickled, it might just return an array
    # of the list of items:
    #
    #     ["item_1", "item_2"]
