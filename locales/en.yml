    errors:
      abstract_method: >
        `%{method}` is an abstract method. You must override this method in
        your subclass with the proper implementation and logic. For more
        information, please see the inline documentation for %{method}. If you
        are not a developer, this is most likely a bug in the ChefAPI gem.
        Please file a bug report at
        https://github.com/sethvargo/chef-api/issues/new and include the
        command(s) you ran to arrive at this error.
      cannot_regenerate_key: >
        You called `regenerate_key` on a client that does not exist on the
        remote Chef Server. You can only regenerate a private key for a client
        that is persisted. Try saving this record this client before
        regenerating the private key.
      file_not_found: >
        I could not find a file at `%{path}`. Please make sure you have typed
        the path correctly and that the resource at `%{path}` does actually
        exist.
      http_method_not_allowed: >
        The HTTP method `%{verb}' is not allowed on the URL `%{url}'.
      insufficient_file_permissions: >
        I cannot read the file at `%{path}` because the permissions on the file
        do not permit it. Please ensure the file has the correct permissions and
        that this Ruby process is running as a user with access to `%{path}`.
      invalid_resource: >
        There were errors saving your resource: %{errors}
      invalid_validator: >
        `%{key}` is not a valid validator. Please make sure it is spelled
        correctly and that the constant is properly defined. If you are using
        a custom validator, please ensure the validator extends
        ChefAPI::Validator::Base and is a subclass of ChefAPI::Validator.
      missing_url_parameter: >
        The required URL parameter `%{param}' was not present. Please specify
        `%{param}' as an option, like Resource.new(id, %{param}: 'value').
      not_a_directory: >
        The given path `%{path}' is not a directory. Please make sure you have
        passed the path to a directory on disk.
      resource_already_exists: >
        The %{type} `%{id}` already exists on the Chef Server. Each
        %{type} must have a unique identifier and the Chef Server indicated
        this %{type} already exists. If you are trying to update the %{type},
        consider using the `update` method instead.
      resource_not_found: >
        There is no %{type} with an id of `%{id}` on the Chef Server. If you
        are updating the %{type}, please make sure the %{type} exists and has
        the correct Chef identifier (primary key).
      resource_not_mutable: >
        The %{type} `%{id}` is not mutable. It may be locked by the remote
        Chef Server, or the Chef Server may not permit modifying the resource.
      server_unavailable: >
        The Chef Server at `%{url}` is unavailable or is not currently
        accepting client connections. Please ensure the server is accessible
        via ping (or telnet) on your local network. If this error persists,
        please contact your network administrator.
      unknown_attribute: >
        `%{attribute}` is not a valid attribute
